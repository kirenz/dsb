Hello!

The core content of this introductory data science course focuses on

-   data acquisition and wrangling,
-   exploratory data analysis,
-   data visualization,
-   inference,
-   modelling, and
-   effective communication of results.

A heavy emphasis is placed on a consistent syntax (with tools from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)), reproducibility (with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)), and version control and collaboration (with Git and GitHub).
